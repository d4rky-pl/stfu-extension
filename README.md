# Shut Up Already!

This is a Chromium extension that I built in 2015 to automatically mute all browser tabs by default.

It was more useful back when loud, obnoxious, autoplaying videos and ads were all the rage.
These days most companies regained their sanity and the videos they're autoplaying are muted
but the extension is still quite helpful in making sure no unnecessary noises are coming from
your browser until you explicitly expect them.

## Changelog

- 2.1.0: Corporate ad-driven garbage bullshit requirement update (converted the extension from manifest v2 to v3)
- 2.0.1: Update privacy practices
- 2.0: Removed popup, added options page and context menu instead. Clicking on mute icon will now toggle mute status.
- 1.2: Added popup with multiple options and settings
- 1.0: Initial release
